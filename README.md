# TwilioQuest

###### Taken straight from the site: https://www.twilio.com/quest 

"TwilioQuest is an educational video game designed to teach a new generation of developers how to change the world with code. TwilioQuest prepares you for real-world programming by helping you configure a local development environment and introducing tools used by professional programmers around the world. From learning how to use your terminal, to coding in Python, JavaScript, and PHP, TwilioQuest will help you develop practical engineering skills."

This repository contains my solutions to challenges presented in TwilioQuest's different learning pods. I've found this method of gamified learning to be really engaging and more dynamic than reading plain-text and regurgitating information on a test.
